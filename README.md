#Logo L-Systems

An implementation of Trees grown with L-Systems written in UCBLogo as part of a student project.

##To Run

Install UCBLog (You can get it here: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/announce).
Then clone this repository unto your machine, cd to the directory and then run this command:

logo main.lg

You may have to play around with screen size as logo does not scale, and the program may crash
occasionally for no explainable reason.
